Notes from Code review - Fri Feb 25 11:06:54 EST 2011

- use setproctitle to set worker process names to app_id
- use django's wsgi server with cherrypy or some other lightweight server
- monitoring: track when apps live/die
  supervisor? or simple shell script to watch a process and restart it?

- distributed logging of app logs (request) and python logging? really request logs should come
   straight from the front end proxy. IT would be nice to aggregate and show these in a web console.
   or perhaps do some visualization for a user.

  cloudera flume - https://github.com/cloudera/flume
  
- separate static media from bundle

- Critical features for beta:
  - finish deploy & frontend tasks
  - provide a way for end users to run custom manage.py commands
  - maybe a way to get a log dump

- Nice but maybe not critical
  - custom domains (not free)
  - payment
  - version rollback (with South integration to track South's versioning changes)
  - varnish cache in front of nginx



DEPLOYMENT STUFF:
- celery user on appserver needs to:
  - need to be able to run supervisorctl as root 
  - need to be able to read/write into /etc/supervisor/conf.d (should be
    writable by the celeryd user)

shimon ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/supervisorctl



TODO:
- provide db creds to non-initial deployments (store in DB and get later)
- store deployment info in DB
- run syncdb & migrate after app installed (but before launched)
- run stuff as app users
